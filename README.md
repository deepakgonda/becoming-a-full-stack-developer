**Becoming a Full Stack Developer (For Beginners)**

Recently I have met many people who want to start their careers as **Full Stack Web Developers / Frontend Developers**. Most of them do not have any degree in Computer Science so they face many difficulties with **how to start** , **what to learn** , **how to find resources** for learning etcâ€¦

I have decided to help them and provide a learning path/roadmap that these guys can use in this journey. I will try to put links for tutorials, videos, and books that can be followed one by one to become successful in this endeavor.

**1. Basic Programming Skills:**

To start this journey, basic programming knowledge is required, which users can get using the following any of the following courses

**3. Web Development Advanced:**

Now Once you have some knowledge of the basic elements of Web Programing, let's dive into learning some advanced concepts for website designing.

There are various frameworks out there that can be used to help in creating stunning websites by using some predefined classes and elements. One such major framework which is widely used is Bootstrap.

**If you reached** here then you know all the elements to design a website properly, but generally, when you are working as a frontend developer/designer in some company most of the time you get the requirement in form of PSD (photoshop templates)/ Adobe Figma design/wireframes, etcâ€¦, so to learn how to process these, please also do watch this tutorial:

If you have mastered all things discussed above you can start applying for the HTML Designers role.

But if you want to become a real frontend developer and get a high-paying job, then you need to learn a few more frameworks that are based on Javascript and used to create SPAs (Single Page Applications) / PWAs (Progressive Web Applications). Two such popular frameworks are:

1. **React:-** [**https://reactjs.org/**](https://reactjs.org/)

1. **Angular:-** [**https://angular.io/**](https://angular.io/)

If you have mastered any one of the above i.e either React or Angular, you can call yourself a **Frontend Developer.**

**Note** :- I will be adding all the links for Backend Development soon in this document.
